# Week 1: Introduction to Machine Learning

## Task 1.1: Exploring Machine Learning with Python

### Objective
Get acquainted with Python tools for data science and explore a basic dataset to understand key statistical concepts.

### Dataset
**Iris Dataset from Kaggle**: This dataset includes 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species along with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- **Link to dataset**: [Iris Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris)

### Activities

#### 1. Set up the environment
- Ensure Python and Jupyter Notebooks are installed.
- Install necessary libraries: `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`.
- Load the dataset using `pandas`.

#### 2. Data Exploration
- Display the first few rows of the dataset to understand its structure.
- Use `pandas` functions like `describe()`, `info()`, and `value_counts()` to gather key statistics and information about the dataset.

#### 3. Visualizations
- Create histograms for each numerical feature to understand distributions.
- Use scatter plots to explore potential relationships between features.
- Employ `seaborn`â€™s `pairplot` to visualize the dataset with hue based on the species.

### Expected Output
A Jupyter notebook that includes:
- Data loading and exploration steps.
- Descriptive statistics and interpretations.
- Visualizations with clear labels and legends.

### Documentation
Follow the provided documentation template to outline the purpose, process, findings, and any insights from the exploratory data analysis.

### General Guidelines for Tasks
- **Comment your code**: Ensure your code in the Jupyter notebook is well-commented to explain why each step is performed.
- **Consistent Formatting**: Use clear headings and subheadings in your Jupyter notebooks and documentation.
- **Testing and Validation**: After each major step, use simple tests or checks to ensure the transformations are performed as expected.
